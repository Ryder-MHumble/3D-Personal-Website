    "A research project that shaped how I connect algorithms with product judgment. It addresses small, dense, and scale-varying objects in UAV remote-sensing imagery with lightweight feature enhancement and detection modules, improving accuracy while keeping deployment cost in view.<br/><br/>The work was published in Scientific Reports and evaluated on datasets such as VisDrone and DOTAv2. This page preserves the research metrics and uses privacy-safe structural visuals rather than claiming to show original paper figures.",
