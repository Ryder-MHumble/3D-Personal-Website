It connects data upload, intelligent annotation, active learning, semi-supervised learning, curriculum learning, model training, evaluation, and iteration feedback into one loop rather than a standalone labeling tool.<br/><br/>GitHub API check on 2026-08-12: 15 stars, Python. The product focus is making every sample-selection decision, annotation action, training result, and quality signal usable for the next model-improvement cycle.",

EvoLabeler treats those steps as an Agent-orchestrated workflow where uncertainty, pseudo-label quality, and training metrics decide the next batch of data and experiments."
