    "TDA-YOLO is an adaptive object-detection framework for UAV remote-sensing imagery. It addresses small, dense, and scale-varying targets with lightweight adaptive weighted downsampling, dynamic upsampling, and a deformable dynamic detection head.<br/><br/>GitHub API check on 2026-08-12: 7 stars. The repository publishes experiment evidence for VisDrone and DOTAv2 and connects model architecture choices with accuracy, computation, and deployability.",

Conventional downsampling can discard critical detail, while heavier receptive-field modules raise deployment cost. TDA-YOLO focuses on retaining useful spatial evidence and adapting sampling to the target rather than applying one fixed operation everywhere.",
