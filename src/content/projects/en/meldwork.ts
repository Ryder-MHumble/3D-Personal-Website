    "Meldwork is a local-first desktop workspace that keeps a task continuous while AI agents change. Each conversation retains its context, attachments, permissions, compatible native session, and sanitized execution history, so direct work can move into bounded multi-Agent review without becoming a chain of copied prompts.<br/><br/>GitHub API check on 2026-08-12: 54 stars, JavaScript. The product focus is durable task context, controlled collaboration, inspectable execution, and local ownership of workspace state.",

Context is copied manually, files are attached again, permissions drift, and a polished final answer can hide how it was produced.
